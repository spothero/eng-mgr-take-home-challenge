# SpotHero Engineering Manager Take-Home Challenge

This repo is for the take-home challenge for engineering manager candidates.
I'd love to keep this repo private, invite candidates to it and have the candidate submit a PR to it.

More info will come later, but we would expect them to:
* Use docker (not necessarily write it)
* Use git
* Write basic SQL statements, maybe use an ORM ([SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for this exercise)
* Be able to understand an app, package manager, set it up locally
* Add new functionality to it

Questions:
* What if the candidate does not know Python? What do we expect from them?
* Can we add tasks to add in different languages? Maybe add tests in
    JavaScript, C#, Java?
